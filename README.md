* make the readme look real fine and swanky
* change the credits bit to a proper bottom-bar thing, and have the sticky section do some fancy scrollfire stuff to not overlap it
* sort out the options
* add usage instructions to the readme for everything
* fix sizescaled mode (average the angles)
* make spiral mode somehow
* paragraphs
